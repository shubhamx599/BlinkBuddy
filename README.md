# BlinkBuddy 👁️

BlinkBuddy is a lightweight, eye-care application designed to help you follow the **20-20-20 rule**—a proven technique to reduce eye strain for people who spend long hours in front of screens. Every 20 minutes, the app reminds you to look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds, helping you blink more and keep your eyes refreshed. Built with Python and Tkinter, BlinkBuddy is perfect for developers, students, or anyone working on a computer for extended periods.

## Features ✨

- **20-20-20 Rule Timer**: Get reminders every 20 minutes to take a 20-second break and look 20 feet away.
- **Auto-Minimize**: The app minimizes to the system tray after break period is over, staying out of your way.
- **Topmost Window**: Break reminders always appear on top of other windows, so you never miss them.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Reminders**: Hear voice reminders during breaks (e.g., "Time to take a break! Look 20 feet away for 20 seconds").
- **Lightweight & Portable**: Single executable file, no installation hassle.
- **Simple UI**: Easy to use Interface that feels smooth.

## How to Download & Use the App 👀

## How It Works 🧠

1. **Run the app** — An intro voice welcomes you:  
2. **Click “Start Session” ✅**
3. **Every 20 minutes:**
   - The window comes to the front
   - Voice alert: _"Time to relax your eyes"_
   - A **20-second countdown** starts on the screen
   - Once done, voice says: _"20 seconds done. You may continue."_
4. **The cycle repeats** automatically every 20 minutes...
5. **Click “Stop Session” 🛑** anytime to pause or exit.

## Future Plans 🔮

BlinkBuddy is a work in progress, and here are some features planned for the future:

- **Custom Countdowns**: Allow users to set custom intervals for reminders (e.g., 30-30-30 rule).
- **Activity Logs**: Track and display a history of breaks taken.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Add support for Linux and macOS with alternative TTS libraries.
- **System Tray Enhancements**: Add options to pause/resume timers from the tray.
- **UI Improvements**: A more modern and customizable UI.
